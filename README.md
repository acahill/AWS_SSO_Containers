# AWS SSO Containers

![](./img/containers.png)

This Firefox extension routes [AWS SSO](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/) requests into their own containers so you can log in to multiple accounts/roles simultaneously.

This extension is pretty basic. If you're looking for something more advanced, check out [Granted](https://docs.commonfate.io/granted/introduction).
